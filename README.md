**Reservations**

To get this up and running, just clone this repo. cd into the directory rake db:migrate, rake db:seed, rails start, then it should be up on local host:3000.

Features I'm working on:

* ~~Dinners & Guests CRUD~~

* ~~Join Table (has_many :through)~~

* ~~Limit # of guests per dinner.~~

* ~~Authentication for creating dinners~~
  User: admin@example.com
  Password: password

* Email guests with calendar event.

* ~~Front-End.~~

* ...
<tt>rake doc:app</tt>.
