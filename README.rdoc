== Reservations

To get this up and running, just clone this repo. cd into the directory rake db:migrate, rake db:seed, rails start, then it should be up on local host:3000.

Features I'm working on:

* <no>Dinners & Guests CRUD</no>

* <no>Join Table (has_many :through)</no>

* <no>Limit # of guests per dinner.</no>

* Authentication for admin.

* Email guests with calendar event.

* Front-End.

* ...
<tt>rake doc:app</tt>.
